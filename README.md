# Bank_Customer_Clustering

## Introduction

### Overview of the Dataset
Bank ABC has collected data on credit card usage from its customers over the past six months, capturing key metrics such as balances, purchases, cash advances, and payment frequencies for each customer. This dataset provides valuable insights into customer behavior, spending patterns, and financial habits.

To better understand and improve their customer service's quality, the marketing team has requested a ****Customer Segmentation Analysis** based on credit card usage data. By identifying customer segments, Bank ABC can tailor its products, offers, and strategies to each group, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### Objectives
- **K-Means Clustering Model**: Create customer segmentation based on credit card usage behaviors using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Each resulting cluster will reflect distinct customer group characteristics, such as purchasing habits and payment patterns. Model performance will be evaluated using the **Silhouette Score**.
- **Business Recommendations**: Provide actionable business recommendations based on the clustering results to help the marketing team design more targeted strategies, such as special offers or service enhancements.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform an in-depth analysis of credit card usage distributions, identify payment patterns, and explore transaction frequency trends. This will provide the marketing team with a deeper understanding of customer behavior and preferences.
